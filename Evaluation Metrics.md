### Accuracy, Precision and Recall

When we look at Classification Metrics - we can look at Accuracy, Precision and Recall. 

Precision - % of correctly labelled positive instances out of all positive labelled instances
Recall - % of correctly labelled positive instances out of all positive instances

In short we can think of Precision vs Recall as two different questions

1. How many retrieved items are relevant?
2. How many relevant items were retrieved?
