- There are three types of machine learning algorithms
	- Supervised Learning : Labels + Data => Goal is to learn a mapping between data and the actual target labels. Examples of tasks that require supervised learning are classification and regression
	- Unsupervised Learning : No Labels + Data => 
	- Reinforcement Learning : Reward System + Environment => Goal is to learn a policy
- Classification
	- This can be binary class or multi-class classification
