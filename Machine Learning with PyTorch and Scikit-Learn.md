- There are three types of machine learning algorithms
	- Supervised Learning : Labels + Data => Goal is to learn a mapping between data and the actual target labels. Examples of tasks that require supervised learning are classification and regression
	- Unsupervised Learning : No Labels + Data => 
	- Reinforcement Learning : Reward System + Environment => Goal is to learn a policy
- Important terminology
	- Training Example: This is a single row in a table representing the dataset 
	- Training: Fitting a model's parameters given a desired objective
	- Feature: A column in a data table/matrix
	- Target: A desired outcome that we want
	- Loss Function: This is a measurement that computes how well our model is performing

When we work with raw data, typically we need to extract meaningful features. A feature in this case is just a measurement that is useful to our final prediction.
