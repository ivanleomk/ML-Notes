Fine-tuning should be considered as a last solution. Often times, it's useful as a way to deal with problems whereby we are working with a lot of complex logic or if-then rules which the model might not be able to follow.

Additionally, if you have custom data, fine-tuning a model might be a way for you to in-house specific capabilities to approach the capabilities of a larger model.
